Spike Pit is a fast-paced, arcade-style volleyball game where strategy meets destruction. Play 1v1 against an AI opponent in a unique 2.5D court where every hit matters and every tile can be destroyed.

This game started as a funny idea I had after playing Nintendo Switch Sports volleyball with my nephews. I thought: "What if every time we spike, the court tiles just... break?" That silly concept stuck with me, and here we are! This is actually my first time making a video game and I used Cursor to code it because I don't know anything about it and I just wanted to quickly test out this idea and see if it's actually fun.

I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think! Any feedback, ideas, or suggestions are more than welcome. This is a learning project for me, so your thoughts really help shape where it goes next. :)

🎮 GAMEPLAY Destroy tiles to create holes on your opponent's side. Score points by making the ball fall through these holes, or win by reducing your opponent's HP to zero. Each rally is a battle of positioning, timing, and tactical destruction.

⚔️ MATCH RULES • First to 11 points OR reduce opponent HP to 0 wins • Each player starts with 10 HP • Falling off the court costs 3 HP • You have 5 touches per side before taking damage • Exceeding the touch limit costs 1 HP per touch

🎯 KEY FEATURES • Destructible Court Tiles - Break tiles to create scoring opportunities • Strategic Spike Serves - Target specific lanes with precision • Forward Toss System - Use O button to toss from spike zone for slow, arcing shots • Touch Limit System - Manage your touches or face HP penalties • Dual Win Conditions - Score points OR deplete opponent HP • Real-time Physics Controls - Adjust game parameters on the fly • Forced Perspective 2.5D - Unique visual style with depth illusion

🎮 CONTROLS • W/A/S/D - Move character • J - Jump • I - Serve/Spike/Receive (hold to charge serve) • O - Forward toss (works from spike zone, both ground and mid-air)

Most actions can be combined with directional keys (W/A/S/D) for aiming.

💡 TIPS • Hold I to charge your serve - release to serve • Press A + I while serving for a spike serve that targets specific lanes • Press O when the ball is in the spike zone to do a forward toss (slow, arcing trajectory) • The spike zone appears when you jump or when you're on the ground and the ball enters the zone • Watch your touch count - exceeding it costs valuable HP • Destroy tiles strategically to create multiple scoring opportunities • The receive zone automatically positions you for returns
